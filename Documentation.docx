# **Gitto - Daily Tech Hack Repository**

## **Project Overview**

**Gitto** is a GitHub repository that automatically updates the `README.md` file with a new tech hack every day. The tech hack will be displayed at the top of the file, and all previous tech hacks will be stored in a table below. This project is designed to increase your GitHub contributions, share valuable tech tips, and help developers enhance their productivity.

### **Features:**
- **Automatic Updates**: A new tech hack is automatically posted to the `README.md` file every day.
- **Tech Hack Table**: Keeps a history of all previous tech hacks in a table format.
- **GitHub Actions**: Uses GitHub Actions to schedule and automate the process, so you don’t need to keep your system running.
- **Version Control**: Uses Git to track changes to the repository.

### **Goal:**
The goal of this project is to share a useful tech hack daily, automating the process of updating the `README.md` file using Python and GitHub Actions. It’s a great way to increase contributions to your GitHub profile while providing value to the developer community.

## **System Requirements**

Before setting up this project, ensure you have the following:

### **1. GitHub Account**
- A GitHub account is required to create and host the repository.
  
### **2. Python**
- Python 3.x installed on your system to run the script locally (not necessary for GitHub Actions).
  
### **3. Git**
- Git is required to version control the repository and push changes to GitHub.

### **4. GitHub Actions**
- GitHub Actions is a cloud-based service provided by GitHub that automates the execution of tasks like updating the README daily.

---

## **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gitto.git
```

### **2. Add Python Script**
- Add the Python script `update_readme.py` to the root directory of the repository.

### **3. Add GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Create the GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/update_hack.yml` in your repository to schedule the script execution every day.

### **4. Modify the Script (Optional)**
- Update the Python script to include your own tech hacks if desired, or modify the logic for fetching hacks from an API or database.

### **5. Push to GitHub**
Push the changes (Python script, workflow file) to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add update_readme.py .github/workflows/update_hack.yml
git commit -m "Add Python script and GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

### **6. Verify the Workflow**
After pushing the changes, verify the workflow’s execution:
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
- Check the workflow runs for success or failure.
- The `README.md` file should update automatically at the specified time (6 PM UTC).

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Python Script (`update_readme.py`)**
- This Python script handles the updating of the `README.md` file. It adds a new tech hack at the top and moves older hacks to a table below.
- The script also commits and pushes the updated `README.md` file back to the repository using Git commands.

### **2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`update_hack.yml`)**
- The GitHub Actions workflow automates the execution of the Python script.
- The `update_hack.yml` file is configured to trigger every day at 6 PM UTC (using a cron job).
- When triggered, it checks out the repository, installs Python dependencies, runs the script, and pushes the changes back to the repository.

### **3. Directory Structure**
Here’s a breakdown of the directory structure for this project:

```bash
/Gitto
  ├── .github/
  │    └── workflows/
  │         └── update_hack.yml   # GitHub Actions workflow file
  ├── update_readme.py             # Python script to update README
  ├── README.md                   # Main README file with tech hacks
  ├── .git/                        # Git folder, automatically created by Git
  └── other files...
```

---

## **Usage**

Once the repository is set up and everything is in place:

- **Automatic Updates**: The tech hack will be updated in the `README.md` file daily at 6 PM UTC.
- **Viewing the README**: Open the repository on GitHub, and the updated `README.md` will reflect the latest tech hack at the top.
- **Contribution**: You can modify the tech hacks or contribute by submitting pull requests to the repository.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **GitHub Actions Not Running**:
  - Ensure that GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository.
  - Check the `Actions` tab for any errors related to the script execution.
  - Make sure your cron expression is valid in `update_hack.yml`.
  
- **Python Script Not Updating README**:
  - Check if the script has the correct permissions to modify the `README.md` file.
  - Make sure the Git commit commands in the script are correct (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`).

- **Incorrect Date/Time**:
  - GitHub Actions uses UTC time. If you’re in a different timezone, make sure to adjust the cron expression accordingly.
